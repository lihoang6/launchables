# 🚀 How to Build Brev Launchables

**Built something in AI? Get 30x more developers to actually try it.**

## The Problem
You share your AI work on GitHub. 98% of developers never see it work because they hit setup/GPU issues.

## The Solution
Turn your notebook into a Launchable. Launchables are shareable AI demos and tutorials that can be created from Jupyter notebooks or GitHub repositories. Developers click a link, land in a GPU notebook in 30 seconds, and **actually try your work**.

## What You'll Learn

- Transform existing notebooks into zero-friction demos
- Add GPU verification and benchmarking
- Create shareable prototypes with one-click GPU access
- Get more adoption, stars, and visibility

## Time Investment

**~30 minutes** to convert your existing notebook into a launchable.

## Prerequisites

- An existing AI notebook (or build one from scratch)
- Basic Python knowledge
- Basic familiarity with Docker (helpful but not required)

**That's it.** Brev provides the GPU and environment automatically.

## Quick Start

1. Click the "Open Notebook" button in the Brev interface
2. Run the first code cell to install dependencies
3. Restart the kernel and run all remaining cells

## 💡 Cost-Effective Learning Tip

GPU instances can be expensive. Start with the smallest GPU instance that meets requirements, and remember to stop your instance when not actively using it. You can also review the [documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/brev/latest/launchables.html) and video tutorials to learn without incurring costs.
