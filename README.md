# 🚀 How to Build Brev Launchables

**Built something in AI? Get 30x more developers to actually try it.**

## The Problem
You share your AI work on GitHub. 98% of developers never see it work because they hit setup/GPU issues.

## The Solution
Turn your notebook into a Launchable. Developers click a link, land in a GPU notebook in 30 seconds, and **actually try your work**.

## What You'll Learn

- Transform existing notebooks into zero-friction demos
- Add GPU verification and benchmarking
- Create shareable prototypes with one-click GPU access
- Get more adoption, stars, and visibility

## Time Investment

**~30 minutes** to convert your existing notebook into a launchable.

## Prerequisites

- An existing AI notebook (or build one from scratch)
- Basic Python knowledge

**That's it.** Brev provides the GPU and environment automatically.

## Get Started

**Click "Open Notebook" to start.** Everything runs in the notebook - no terminal setup required.

*For developers who built something in AI and want more people to actually try it* 💚
