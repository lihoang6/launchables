# 🚀 Turn Your Notebook into a Launchable
## *From Demo to GPU-Backed Distribution*

Welcome! If you've built a notebook showcasing your AI work - whether it's a library, model, technique, or tutorial - this guide shows you how to transform it into a **Launchable**: instantly accessible to developers worldwide with GPU backing.

---

## Why Launchables?

**The Problem**: You've built something amazing. But developers:
- ❌ Struggle with setup and dependencies
- ❌ Don't have GPUs to run your demos
- ❌ Give up before seeing your innovation
- ❌ Can't easily share with their teams

**The Solution**: Launchables on Brev
- ✅ One click → Instant GPU environment
- ✅ Pre-configured and working
- ✅ Shareable link → Anyone can try it
- ✅ Higher adoption and engagement

---

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this tutorial:

✅ **Learn** the essential components of Launchables and transform your current work (in this example, we're going to configure Unsloth to enable access to 181+ notebooks) 
✅ **Package Your Existing Notebook** - Transform your current work (in this example, we're going to configure Unsloth to enable access to 181+ notebooks) 
✅ **Deploy to Brev** - One-click hosting with GPU Acceleration 
✅ **Share with the World** - Give developers and team members instant access  

> **💡 Key Insight**: A Launchable is just a well-structured notebook + requirements.txt + GPU verification. You probably already have 80% of what you need!

**The Impact**:

| Metric | Before Launchables | After Launchables | Impact |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|
| Setup Time | 2+ hours | 30 seconds | **240x faster** |
| Success Rate | ~30% | ~95% | **3x more** adoption |
| User Friction | High | None | Lower churn |
| Viral Sharing | Difficult | One link | Easier growth |

## Real Example: A Developer using Unsloth

**Before**: Unsloth had a notebook showing 2x faster fine-tuning. Users had to:
- Clone repo, install dependencies, get a GPU, debug issues → 2+ hours
- Success rate: ~30% of users

**After**: Developer created a Launchable. Users:
- Click link → Working environment in 30 seconds
- Success rate: ~95% of users
- **Result**: 3x more developers trying and adopting Unsloth

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Launch on Brev (Recommended - Has GPU!)
1. Click the Brev launch button (coming soon)
2. The notebook opens with GPU ready
3. Follow along interactively

### Option 2: Run Locally (For Planning)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lihoang6/launchables.git
cd launchables
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook how-to-build-launchables.ipynb
```

> ⚠️ **Note**: GPU verification examples require an NVIDIA GPU. You can read through locally, but the full experience requires GPU access.
