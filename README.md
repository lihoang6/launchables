- Try port 8081, 8082, or another available port

**Browser doesn't open automatically:**
- Manually navigate to `http://localhost:8080` in your browser

### NVIDIA NIM API Issues

**Authentication errors:**
- Verify your API key from [build.nvidia.com](https://build.nvidia.com/)
- Ensure the key is correctly set in the notebook

**Rate limiting:**
- NVIDIA API has rate limits; add delay between requests if needed
- Consider caching responses for development

**Connection errors:**
- Check internet connectivity
- Verify firewall settings aren't blocking API requests
