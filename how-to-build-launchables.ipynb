        "**For most launchables:**\n",
        "- **1x L40s** or **1x A100 (40GB)** - Perfect for demos, tutorials, small models\n",
        "- **Cost-effective** - Lower credits per hour\n",
        "- **Fast startup** - More availability\n",
        "- **Sufficient** - Most demos don't need massive compute\n",
        "\n",
        "**When to scale up:**\n",
        "- **2x-4x GPUs** - Only if your demo actually uses multiple GPUs (distributed training, large batch inference)\n",
        "- **8x GPUs** - AVOID unless absolutely necessary (rare for demos)\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🎯 Match GPU to Use Case\n",

        "| Your Launchable Shows | Recommended GPU |\n",

        "| Large models (13-70B params) | 1x H100 or 1x H200 |\n",
